                        The way organizations are approaching product development and emerging technologies are constantly changing. At the same time our practice as designers is evolving with new tools, techniques, and approaches, surfacing at a pace that can be hard to keep
                        up with. What does this mean for us as leaders of teams (big or small)? How can we lead teams in progressive orgs going through digital transformation or orgs that are slower to adapt? By focusing on developing certain skills,
                        disciplines, and characteristics, within ourselves as leaders, we prepare ourselves for the challenges we face when leading our teams and working with our partners. We also set ourselves up to be leaders that can coach, nurture,
                        and elevate our teams to be best equipped for the challenges they face as they execute on their work. In this presentation, Aaron will share insights, tools, and techniques (from personal success and failures) for growing his own
                        leadership skills, overcoming leadership challenges, and successfully developing teams.
